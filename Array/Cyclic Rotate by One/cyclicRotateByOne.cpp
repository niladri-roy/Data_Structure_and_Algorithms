/*
Approach 1:
*Use two pointers approach and point the first and the last element of the array.
*Swap the elements, and
*Do the obvious increment.

Approach 1 , Explanation:

We can use two pointers,
say i and j which point to first and last element of array respectively.
As we know in cyclic rotation we will bring last element to first and
shift rest in forward direction,
so start swaping arr[i] and arr[j] and
keep j fixed and i moving towards j.
Repeat till i is not equal to j
